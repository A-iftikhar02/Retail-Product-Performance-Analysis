
#  Retail Product Performance Analysis â€“ EDA with Pandas

##  Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset to uncover performance trends across products, regions, and time. It simulates a real-world business scenario where a data analyst is tasked with understanding key revenue drivers using Python.

We aim to extract insights on sales trends, top-performing products, and purchasing patterns by analyzing historical transactional data.

##  Key Insights

- **Laptops and Phones** generated the highest total revenue.
-  **Electronics** category had the highest average price.
- **Revenue peaks** occurred during select months, showing seasonal spikes.
- **The West region** had the highest sales contribution.

##  Tools & Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- CSV-based Dataset (~9,000 rows)

##  Project Structure

Retail_Sales_EDA/
 - retail_eda.py # Python script with code and visualizations
 - retail_sales_data_large.csv # Cleaned dataset
 - README.md # Project summary and reflection




##  Challenges Faced

- **Missing values** were handled by filling or removing non-critical records.
- **Date parsing** and feature engineering (year, month, weekday) were key for time-based insights.
- **Grouped aggregations** required careful selection of features for correct interpretation.

##  How to Run the Project

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/retail_eda.git
cd retail_eda
Open the script in VS Code or run it directly:


python retail_sales_eda.py
Visualizations will appear as output, and insights will print to the console or notebook.
